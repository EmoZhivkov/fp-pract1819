# Useful general info

## Homeworks

Homework handover is done through the Moodle system we have at FMI.
For questions on homeworks you can (ordered by preference):

1. Use the mailing list.
2. Contact me directly (through one of the methods).

Public methods are best, because others can also read discussions there.

Your points on each homework and total points will be shown in a google doc, which doesn't exist as of yet.

### Homework guidelines

#### Function names
>    Functions must be named the same way as in the tasks.

#### File organisation
>    If you are handing in a single file, it must be named <your fn>.{rkt,scm,..} and it must (export) **provide** all the functions
>    which are specified in the tasks.
>
>    If you are handing in more than one file, they should be in a folder named <your fn>, which is afterwards **tar**/**zip**-ed.
>    Furthermore, inside it there should be one "all" file named <your fn>.{rkt,scm,..}, which (imports) **require**s all the other files,
>    and then (re-exports) **provide**s all the functions which are specified in the tasks.
